<h1>The Best Movies According to Astrid</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Romancing the Stone</h3>
<p>This is a classic adventure movie that has all the elements that I love. There's exotic locations, secrets in the jungle, the hunt for a precious stone, ancient profecies, and - of course - there is a love story that has a good ending. On top of that it has a good dose of humor and great actors.</p>
<h3>The Abyss</h3>
<p>This is a sci-fi movie that takes place in the deepest oceans, a place that has not been explored by humans. I love movies that are about ocean discoveries, adventure, and a great alien discovery. Good actors, strong story, and edge of your seat excitement.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Amazing actors, fantastic story line, and simply a classic that has to be in everyone's top 3.</p>
